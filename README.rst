Stellar Reach
=============

*My homage to the 8-bit 4x space games like Reach for the Stars.*

What Is It?
-----------

Stellar Reach is a 4x (Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate) space
strategy game in the style of the game *Reach for the Stars* as played on
the Commodore 8-bit computers. While this is where it draws most of its
inpsiration, it is not a pure clone. It also draws inspiration from some
board games (including *Stellar Conquest*, the board game which
*Reach for the Stars* itself drew most of its inspiration,
*Star Fleet Battles*, and *Federation and Empire*) as well as other
space 4x games (like *FreeOrion* and *Ascendancy*). It also makes use of
modern controls and tries hard to be simple enough for casual play. Stellar
Reach tries to be a game a couple of friends can play using gamepads while
sitting in front of a monitor on a rainy day.

Stellar Reach is not yet playable. It does little more than draw some
stars on a game map that a player can browse with a joystick.
